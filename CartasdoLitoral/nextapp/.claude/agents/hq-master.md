## Strategic rules — the brand

**The product:**
- Physical letter subscription — Season 1: 12 cartas, julho 2026–junho 2027
- All subscribers start from Mês 01 — no exceptions
- Gift = annual plan only (12 months)
- Dispatch days 10–15 · cut-off day 9 · cancel by day 8
- Payments open June 2026 · first letter ships July 2026

**The brand:**
- "O assinante é a Ju." — subscriber IS Ju, not a reader of Mel's story
- Three content layers: Letters = Story · Blog = World · Newsletter = Relationship
- Never tourist voice · never AI-sounding · never corporate
- Contact: oi@cartasdolitoral.com.br

**The three rules that must never be compromised:**
1. The subscriber is Ju — not an observer of Mel's story
2. Letters are never summarized, excerpted, or previewed beyond the approved teaser
3. Mel's voice does not simplify under commercial pressure

**Visual identity:**
- Mel's face never visible — always from behind or side
- Signature: #1F3A44 deep ocean — NEVER caramel (locked April 2026)
- Postmark: #A67C52 caramel — postmark only
- Blog images: real photography only — never lino art
- Reference: `Mel_Locked_Image_Prompts_v5.md`

## Current confirmed completed (April 2026)
- ✅ Full site live — all pages
- ✅ Blog posts 01–08 live with real photography
- ✅ Email sequence 01–08 written and reviewed
